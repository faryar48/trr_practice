# A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
# They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

# It must
# be love
# Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

# As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

# They are defined as hashes â†´ like this:

#   my_rectangle = {

#     # coordinates of bottom-left corner:
#     'x' => 1,
#     'y' => 5,

#     # width and height
#     'width' => 10,
#     'height' => 4,

# }

# Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
